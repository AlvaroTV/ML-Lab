# Custom Deep Learning Models from Scratch
This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with custom implementations of deep learning models from scratch. While using pre-existing models from libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow is common practice and often recommended for real-world applications, implementing models from scratch provides valuable insights into the inner workings of neural networks and enhances understanding of fundamental concepts in deep learning.
  
# Motivation
Building deep learning models from scratch offers several benefits:
* **Educational Purposes**: Implementing models from scratch helps deepen understanding of neural network architectures, optimization algorithms, and other key concepts in deep learning.
* **Flexibility and Control**: Custom implementations provide flexibility to experiment with novel architectures, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques.
* **Research and Innovation**: By exploring custom implementations, researchers and practitioners can push the boundaries of existing methodologies and develop innovative approaches to tackle complex problems.

# Experiments
This repository includes experiments with various deep learning architectures, including but not limited to:
* **ResNet**: Explore the ResNet architecture and its variants, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-34, etc.
* **VGG**: Implement the VGG architecture with different depths (e.g., VGG-16, VGG-19).
* **U-Net**: Implement the U-Net architecture.
